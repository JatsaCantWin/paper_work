# Paper Work
#### A 2D puzzle game with office stamps, and paperwork

Welcome to Paper Work, a game where you'll take on the challenge of navigating a complex office building to solve bureaucratic errands, collect stamps, sign documents, and get lost in a complex and overgrown administrative maze.

## Gameplay

In this game, you'll have to solve administrative tasks, such as getting a driver's license issued, renewing a passport, applying for a loan, etc. You'll have to gather several stamps from different offices to get through the paperwork. You can expect the bureaucrats there to know how to complicate matters further. To win the game, you'll need to gather every stamp and signature on your document, making sure not to lose any copies of various documents you've gathered along the way, and hopefully, your sanity.

## Technology

The game was made with Unity Engine, using the Unity 2D suite.
